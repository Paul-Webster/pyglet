Fork with emphasis on full python 3.4 support (no 2to3), PEP8 compliance and
internal consistency.

      commit: 6a2e594e5aac701cd0d710047925aee087060606
    * removed legacy carbon code
    * removed contrib/layout/browser
    * removed experimental/gui
    * removed other unmaintained demo code under experimental/
    * very good PEP8 compliance
    * ran entire codebase through 2to3
    * changed test names to lowercase (seriously why were they all caps?)
    * made tests in tests more specific; ie.
      change assertTrue(z==y) to assertEquals(z, y)
    * condensed many tests into one test file and removed the need for a window
      to be opened in many cases
    * converted many getter/setters to decorated methods
    * moved TextureGroup to text, since it was only used there, and not meant to
      be used.  Docstrings said "don't use, just an example"
    * tests are now split between unit tests and integration tests;
      the benefit will be easier entry point into mocked tests and reduced
      burden on the developer to run the full interactive test suite
    * removed leading underscores in win32._kernel32, _gdi32, _user32, _shell32
    * many names marked private with leading underscores were being imported and
      used in other modules.  To make it consistent, leading underscores in
      those names have been removed.
    * removed the global clock.  use pyglet.app.event_loop.clock instead
    * removed custom sphinx parsing.  will use vanilla spinx for modern look
    * updated many docstrings
    * rename euclid to pyglet/math.py
    * removed any classes/methods/functions with 'depreciated' in docstring
      and provided a fix using new api in occasions where the pyglet lib was
      internally still using depreciated api
    * updated astraea demo to [my] modern pyglet
    * removed _eos_XXX attributes and associated legacy functions from media
    * pyglet.media has names that shadow built-in bytes; renamed bytes_/bytes
    * removed unneeded shebangs
    * removed __docformat__ because there will be just one format
    * removed __version__ in submodules because it is useless
    * remove app.WeakSet and replaced all refs. to python sdt lib implementation
    * merged Clock.tick and Clock.update time methods into tick
    * re-imagined the clock scheduler with a heapq core.  about 470% faster
    * pyglet.clock.Clock will not sleep
    * moved sleeping functions into app event loop
    * moved sleep function for win32 from clock into app.win32
    * made Sprite.subpixel True by default, because it looks better by default
    * new NoHandlerException in event, raised when no handlers for an event type
    * cleaned up profanity in ttf.py
    * added check for windows xp and lower in app.eventloop.run
      this check determines if the least squares regression should be used
    * win32 event handlers return None to let windows manage message
      return 0 will have message discarded
      it seems this was the intended behaviour, but implementation prevented it

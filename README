pyglet - Leif's Fork
====================

Fork with emphasis on full python 3.4 support (no 2to3), PEP8 compliance and
internal consistency.  This can be considered a change of goals to a game
framework without generic goals of a 'multimedia' framework, as well as
making it more modern and accessible to new people.

This fork isn't meant to be a replacement of pyglet.  There are a few changes
in the core that will break projects.

Please see CHANGELOG for details
